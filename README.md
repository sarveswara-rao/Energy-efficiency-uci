# Estimating the energy requirements of the buildings
Project description: This study looked into assessing the heating load and cooling load requirements of buildings (that is, energy efficiency) as a function of building parameters.

### Library requirements
* Numpy, pandas, Scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Dataset
* Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency
* Description: Dataset Contains 8 building paramters as inputs and two target variables namely Cooling load and Heating Load
